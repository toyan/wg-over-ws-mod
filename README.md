### Wireguard-over-Websockets Config

This project explains the steps to enable a Wireguard VPN connection to be tunnelled over a Secure Websockets (WSS) connection for use cases where outbound VPN traffic may be blocked/filtered/monitored.

The following steps assume that there is already a Wireguard connection established that is to be mondified for tunelling over WSS.

#### Server Configuration

No modifications need to be made to the Wireguard server configuration itself, but `wstunnel` needs to be installed and configured as a systemd unit.

1. Download the latest wstunnel [release](https://github.com/erebe/wstunnel/releases)
2. Copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin/wstunnel`
3. Allow the binary to listen on privileged ports:

```bash
$ sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /usr/local/bin/wstunnel
```

4. Create the following service file at `/etc/systemd/system/wstunnel.service`:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Tunnel WG UDP over websocket
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=nobody
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/wstunnel -v --server wss://0.0.0.0:443 --restrictTo=127.0.0.1:51820
Restart=no

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

5. Start and enable the service:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable wstunnel
$ sudo systemctl start wstunnel
```

If relying solely on the software firewall installed on the droplet, ensure that inbound traffic to port 443 is permitted. If relying upon DigitalOcean cloud firewall, see later steps for dynamically allowing traffic through during connection establishment using the DigitalOcean API.

#### Client Configuration

Ensure dependencies are installed (debian-based example):

```
apt update && apt install -y curl jq
```

1. Download the latest wstunnel [release](https://github.com/erebe/wstunnel/releases)
2. Copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin/wstunnel`
3. Copy existing config to `/etc/wireguard/wss.conf`
4. If using the DigitalOcean firewall script, install `do-firewall.sh` to `/etc/wireguard/do-firewall.sh` and modify to include a valid DigitalOcean API key. [(script)](./do-firewall.sh)
5. Install `wstunnel.sh` to `/etc/wireguard/wstunnel.sh` [(script)](./wstunnel.sh)
6. Create a connection specific config file at `/etc/wireguard/wss.wstunnel` [(example)](./wss.wstunnel):

```
REMOTE_HOST=some.server.com
REMOTE_PORT=64451
UPDATE_HOSTS='/etc/hosts'

# Change if using nginx with custom prefix for added security
# WS_PREFIX='E7m5vGDqryd55MMP'

# Change if running WSS on a non-standard port, i.e. 4443
# WSS_PORT=443

# Can change local port of the wstunnel, don't forget to change Peer.Endpoint
# LOCAL_PORT=${REMOTE_PORT}

# If using dnsmasq can supply other file than /etc/hosts
# UPDATE_HOSTS='/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/hosts/tunnels'

# Will send -HUP to dnsmasq to reload hosts
# USING_DNSMASQ=1
```

Next we will modify the client confg to configure routing and point at the correct endpoint for our websockets tunnel. (Or cheat, and look at the [example config](./wss.conf))

1. Ensure the `Endpoint` directive is pointing at `127.0.0.1:64451`
2. Add the following lines to the `[Interface]` section:

```
Table = off
PreUp = source /etc/wireguard/wstunnel.sh && pre_up %i
PostUp = source /etc/wireguard/wstunnel.sh && post_up %i
PostDown = source /etc/wireguard/wstunnel.sh && post_down %i
```

**Note:**: Additional config required to include the DigitalOcean firewall script. [Example](./wss-with-firewall.conf)

#### Finish

The tunnelling should now be configured - ensure the server is running and `wstunnel` is started on the server and initiate a connection - you should then be able to see the tunnel established by running `wg`.

Ensure that all files under `/etc/wireguard` are owned by root:

```
$ chown -R root: /etc/wireguard
$ chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/*
$ chmod 700 /etc/wireguard/do-firewall.sh
```

#### Notes on DigitalOcean Firewall Script

The script is relatively naive, and assumes that only 1 firewall is associcated with the DigitalOcean account.

The `do-firewall.sh` script provides 3 commands:

1. `./do-firewall.sh info` - display firewall information
2. `./do-firewall.sh allow` - allow inbound 443/tcp traffic
3. `./do-firewall.sh deny` - deny inbound 443/tcp traffic (optionally specify wait to disable after 60s - e.g. `./do-firewall.sh deny wait`)
